* Re-sync the project with the upstream repository.
* The upstream repository has changes to the files, new files, or removed files.
* The goal is to update all the files in this version as well and update css-zero.css file when necessary, so that all the changes are reflected in this version.
* You will need to move and override the files correctly without modifying the currenst structure of the fork.
* Also rebase the current fork on the latest version of the upstream repository.
* At the end, run `ruby check_sync.rb` to verify that the project is synced correctly. If not, fix the issues and run the command again.
