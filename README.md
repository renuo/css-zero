# CSS Zero (as a Rails Engine)

Refer to the original repository for more information about the project: https://github.com/lazaronixon/css-zero

When using this fork, the css-zero assets will be provided in a Rails Engine.

This means you can use direclty CSS, Javascript, and images without copy-pasting them into your app.

## Installation

Add this gem to your project.

```
gem css-zero, github: renuo/css-zero
```

Enjoy your resources.


## Development

The only thing needed to do, is to periodically merge the changes from the original repo into this one.
In order to do that there's two parts:

a script `ruby check_sync.rb` that will check if all resources are present and up-to-date with upstream.

`/sync` cursor command to sync the changes.

## Contributing
